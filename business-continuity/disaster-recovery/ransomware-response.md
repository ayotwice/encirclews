# Ransomware Response Scenario

## Scenario Overview
**Incident**: Ransomware attack detected on corporate network with encrypted files and ransom demand
**Attack Vector**: Phishing email with malicious attachment
**Scope**: 150+ workstations affected, file servers encrypted, backup systems targeted
**Ransom Demand**: $500,000 in Bitcoin with 72-hour deadline

## Immediate Response (0-60 minutes)

### Step 1: Containment (0-15 minutes)
**CRITICAL: Do not power off infected systems immediately - preserve evidence**

#### Network Isolation
```bash
# Isolate affected network segments
# Block malicious IPs at firewall
iptables -A INPUT -s <malicious_ip> -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -d <malicious_ip> -j DROP

# Disable network access for affected VLANs
# Contact network team to isolate subnets
```

#### System Isolation Checklist
- [ ] Identify patient zero and affected systems
- [ ] Isolate infected network segments
- [ ] Disable remote access (VPN, RDP)
- [ ] Block suspicious outbound connections
- [ ] Preserve system state for forensics

### Step 2: Team Activation (15-30 minutes)
- [ ] Activate incident response team
- [ ] Notify CISO and executive leadership
- [ ] Contact cyber insurance provider
- [ ] Engage external forensics team
- [ ] Notify legal counsel

**Emergency Contacts:**
- CISO: <Name> (+1-555-0301)
- Legal Counsel: <Firm> (+1-555-LAW-FIRM)
- Cyber Insurance: <Provider> (+1-800-CYBER-INS)
- FBI Cyber Division: +1-855-292-3937

### Step 3: Assessment (30-60 minutes)
- [ ] Identify ransomware variant (file extensions, ransom note)
- [ ] Assess scope of encryption
- [ ] Check backup system integrity
- [ ] Evaluate business impact
- [ ] Document evidence for law enforcement

## Investigation & Analysis (1-4 hours)

### Forensic Analysis
#### System Analysis Commands
```bash
# Check for ransomware indicators
find / -name "*.encrypted" -o -name "*.locked" -o -name "*README*"

# Analyze running processes
ps aux | grep -E "(encrypt|crypt|ransom)"

# Check network connections
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

# Review system logs
tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep -i "ransom\|encrypt\|malware"
```

#### Evidence Collection
- [ ] Create forensic images of key systems
- [ ] Collect network traffic captures
- [ ] Preserve ransom notes and communications
- [ ] Document timeline of events
- [ ] Identify attack vector and entry point

### Backup Assessment
#### Backup Validation Process
```bash
# Check backup integrity
rsync --dry-run --checksum /backup/location/ /test/restore/

# Verify backup timestamps
ls -la /backup/daily/ | head -10

# Test restore capability
tar -tzf backup_20231201.tar.gz | head -20
```

#### Backup Status Checklist
- [ ] Verify offline backup availability
- [ ] Check backup integrity and completeness
- [ ] Identify last clean backup date
- [ ] Test restore procedures
- [ ] Assess recovery time requirements

## Recovery Strategy (4-24 hours)

### Option 1: Restore from Backups (Recommended)
#### Prerequisites
- [ ] Confirmed clean backup availability
- [ ] Network fully sanitized
- [ ] Malware removed from all systems
- [ ] Security controls enhanced

#### Restoration Process
```bash
# Rebuild critical servers from clean images
# Restore data from last clean backup
rsync -av --progress /backup/clean/database/ /var/lib/mysql/

# Verify data integrity
mysql -u root -p -e "CHECK TABLE users, orders, products;"

# Update security patches
apt update && apt upgrade -y
yum update -y
```

### Option 2: Negotiation (Last Resort)
**Note: Payment not recommended - no guarantee of decryption**
- [ ] Engage specialized negotiation firm
- [ ] Verify decryption capability
- [ ] Coordinate with law enforcement
- [ ] Document all communications

## Recovery Execution

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Rebuild (4-12 hours)
#### Clean Room Environment
- [ ] Set up isolated recovery network
- [ ] Deploy clean server images
- [ ] Install latest security patches
- [ ] Configure enhanced monitoring

#### System Restoration Priority
1. **Critical Systems (0-4 hours)**
   - Domain controllers
   - Email servers
   - Core business applications

2. **Important Systems (4-8 hours)**
   - File servers
   - Database servers
   - Web applications

3. **Standard Systems (8-12 hours)**
   - User workstations
   - Development environments
   - Non-critical applications

### Phase 2: Data Recovery (8-16 hours)
#### Database Restoration
```sql
-- Restore database from clean backup
RESTORE DATABASE ProductionDB 
FROM DISK = 'C:\Backups\ProductionDB_Clean.bak'
WITH REPLACE, RECOVERY;

-- Verify data integrity
DBCC CHECKDB('ProductionDB');

-- Update statistics
UPDATE STATISTICS ProductionDB;
```

#### File System Recovery
```bash
# Restore file shares
rsync -av /backup/clean/shares/ /srv/shares/

# Set proper permissions
chown -R www-data:www-data /srv/shares/
chmod -R 755 /srv/shares/

# Verify file integrity
find /srv/shares/ -type f -exec md5sum {} \; > /tmp/restored_checksums.txt
```

### Phase 3: Security Hardening (12-24 hours)
#### Enhanced Security Measures
- [ ] Deploy additional endpoint protection
- [ ] Implement application whitelisting
- [ ] Enable advanced threat detection
- [ ] Configure behavioral monitoring
- [ ] Update all security policies

#### Network Security Updates
```bash
# Update firewall rules
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3389 -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3389 -j DROP

# Enable network segmentation
# Configure micro-segmentation rules
# Implement zero-trust principles
```

## Business Continuity Measures

### Temporary Workarounds
- [ ] Activate manual processes for critical functions
- [ ] Set up temporary communication channels
- [ ] Implement paper-based workflows
- [ ] Coordinate with business units on priorities
