# Cloud Outage Scenario - AWS Multi-AZ Failure

## Scenario Overview
**Incident**: Complete failure of primary AWS region (us-east-1) affecting all production workloads
**Impact**: All customer-facing services unavailable, internal systems offline
**Duration**: Estimated 6-12 hours for full AWS recovery
**Business Impact**: $50K/hour revenue loss, 10,000+ affected customers

## Immediate Response (0-30 minutes)

### Step 1: Incident Confirmation (0-5 minutes)
- [ ] Verify AWS Service Health Dashboard
- [ ] Confirm multiple AZ failure in primary region
- [ ] Check secondary region (us-west-2) status
- [ ] Validate monitoring alerts and metrics

### Step 2: Team Activation (5-15 minutes)
- [ ] Activate DR team via PagerDuty
- [ ] Establish incident command center
- [ ] Notify executive leadership
- [ ] Contact AWS Enterprise Support

**Key Personnel:**
- DR Manager: <Name> (+1-555-0401)
- Infrastructure Lead: <Name> (+1-555-0101)
- Application Lead: <Name> (+1-555-0201)
- Database Lead: <Name> (+1-555-0301)

### Step 3: Initial Assessment (15-30 minutes)
- [ ] Assess scope of affected services
- [ ] Verify backup region readiness
- [ ] Check RDS read replica status in us-west-2
- [ ] Validate backup data availability

## Recovery Execution (30 minutes - 4 hours)

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Failover (30-90 minutes)

#### DNS Failover
```bash
# Update Route 53 health checks
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z123456789 \
  --change-batch file://failover-changeset.json

# Verify DNS propagation
dig api.company.com
nslookup app.company.com
```

#### Load Balancer Activation
- [ ] Activate Application Load Balancer in us-west-2
- [ ] Update target groups with DR instances
- [ ] Configure health checks
- [ ] Test load balancer functionality

#### Auto Scaling Group Scaling
```bash
# Scale up DR environment
aws autoscaling update-auto-scaling-group \
  --auto-scaling-group-name prod-web-asg-west \
  --desired-capacity 10 \
  --region us-west-2
```

### Phase 2: Database Recovery (60-120 minutes)

#### RDS Failover Process
```bash
# Promote read replica to primary
aws rds promote-read-replica \
  --db-instance-identifier prod-db-replica-west \
  --region us-west-2

# Update connection strings
kubectl patch configmap app-config \
  -p '{"data":{"DB_HOST":"prod-db-west.cluster-xyz.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com"}}'
```

#### Data Validation Checklist
- [ ] Verify database connectivity
- [ ] Check data consistency and integrity
- [ ] Validate recent transactions
- [ ] Test read/write operations
- [ ] Confirm backup processes active

### Phase 3: Application Recovery (90-180 minutes)

#### Container Deployment
```bash
# Deploy applications to DR region
kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/production/ --context=us-west-2

# Scale critical services
kubectl scale deployment api-service --replicas=5 --context=us-west-2
kubectl scale deployment web-frontend --replicas=3 --context=us-west-2
```

#### Configuration Updates
- [ ] Update API endpoints in applications
- [ ] Reconfigure third-party integrations
- [ ] Update CDN origin servers
- [ ] Validate SSL certificates

#### Service Validation
- [ ] Test user authentication
- [ ] Verify payment processing
- [ ] Check email notifications
- [ ] Validate API functionality
- [ ] Test mobile app connectivity

## Service Restoration Validation (3-4 hours)

### Functional Testing
```bash
# Automated health checks
curl -f https://api.company.com/health
curl -f https://app.company.com/status

# Database connectivity test
psql -h prod-db-west.cluster-xyz.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com -U appuser -c "SELECT 1;"
```

### Performance Validation
- [ ] Monitor response times < 500ms
- [ ] Verify throughput meets 80% of normal capacity
- [ ] Check error rates < 0.1%
- [ ] Validate concurrent user capacity

### Business Process Testing
- [ ] Complete end-to-end user registration
- [ ] Process test payment transaction
- [ ] Verify report generation
- [ ] Test customer support tools

## Communication Timeline

### T+15 minutes: Initial Notification
```
Subject: CRITICAL - AWS Region Outage Affecting All Services

We are experiencing a complete outage of our primary AWS region. 
All customer-facing services are currently unavailable.

Actions: Activating disaster recovery procedures
ETA: 4 hours for full service restoration
Next Update: 30 minutes
```

### T+2 hours: Progress Update
```
Subject: UPDATE - DR Activation in Progress

Infrastructure failover to backup region is 70% complete.
Database promotion successful, application deployment in progress.

Current Status: Services partially restored
ETA: 2 hours for full restoration
Next Update: 1 hour
```

### T+4 hours: Service Restoration
```
Subject: RESOLVED - Services Restored via Disaster Recovery

All services have been successfully restored via our backup region.
Performance monitoring shows normal operations resumed.

Actions: Continuing to monitor, planning return to primary region
Post-Incident Review: Scheduled for tomorrow 2 PM
```

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Application response times
- Database connection pool utilization
- Error rates and exceptions
- User authentication success rates
- Payment processing success rates

### Alert Thresholds (Adjusted for DR)
- Response time > 1000ms (normally 500ms)
- Error rate > 1% (normally 0.1%)
- Database connections > 80% (normally 70%)
- CPU utilization > 85% (normally 75%)

## Return to Primary Region

### Prerequisites for Failback
- [ ] AWS confirms full region restoration
- [ ] Primary region stability verified for 4+ hours
- [ ] Data synchronization completed
- [ ] Change freeze lifted

### Failback Process (Planned Maintenance Window)
1. **Data Synchronization** (2 hours)
   - Sync database changes back to primary
   - Verify data consistency
   - Update application configurations

2. **Gradual Traffic Migration** (1 hour)
   - Route 10% traffic to primary region
   - Monitor for 30 minutes
   - Gradually increase to 100%

3. **DR Environment Scaling Down** (30 minutes)
   - Scale down DR resources
   - Maintain minimal standby capacity
   - Update monitoring configurations

## Lessons Learned Template

### What Went Well
