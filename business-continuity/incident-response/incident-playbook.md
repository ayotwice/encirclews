# Incident Response Playbook

## Overview
This playbook provides standardized procedures for managing IT incidents to minimize business impact and restore services quickly.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels
- **P1 (Critical)**: Complete service outage, security breach, data loss
- **P2 (High)**: Major functionality impaired, significant user impact
- **P3 (Medium)**: Minor functionality issues, limited user impact
- **P4 (Low)**: Cosmetic issues, minimal business impact

### Response Times (SLA)
- P1: 15 minutes initial response, 4 hours resolution target
- P2: 30 minutes initial response, 8 hours resolution target
- P3: 2 hours initial response, 24 hours resolution target
- P4: 4 hours initial response, 72 hours resolution target

## Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection & Initial Response (0-15 minutes)
1. **Incident Identification**
   - Monitor alerts from monitoring systems
   - User reports via service desk

   - Assign preliminary severity level
   - Document in incident management system

3. **Immediate Actions**
   - Notify on-call engineer
   - Create incident ticket
   - Begin impact assessment

### Phase 2: Investigation & Diagnosis (15-60 minutes)
1. **Team Assembly**
   - Engage appropriate technical teams
   - Establish incident commander
   - Set up communication bridge

2. **Root Cause Analysis**

### Phase 3: Resolution & Recovery (Ongoing)
1. **Implement Fix**
   - Apply temporary workaround if available
   - Implement permanent solution
   - Test resolution thoroughly

2. **Service Restoration**
   - Verify system functionality
   - Monitor for stability
   - Confirm user access restored

3. **Communication Updates**
   - Notify stakeholders of resolution
   - Update status page
   - Close incident ticket

### Phase 4: Post-Incident Review (24-48 hours after resolution)
1. **Documentation**
