# SOC 2 Evidence Collection Workflow

## Overview
This document outlines the systematic approach for collecting, organizing, and maintaining evidence to support SOC 2 Type II compliance audits.

## Evidence Collection Framework

### Evidence Categories
1. **Policies & Procedures** - Written documentation of controls
2. **System Configurations** - Technical control implementations
3. **Monitoring Reports** - Ongoing operational evidence
4. **Training Records** - Personnel competency documentation
5. **Incident Reports** - Exception handling and remediation
6. **Third-Party Assessments** - External validation and certifications

## Collection Schedule

### Daily Evidence
- **SIEM/Security Logs** - Automated collection via Splunk
- **System Performance Metrics** - Datadog dashboards and alerts
- **Backup Verification** - Automated backup success reports
- **Access Logs** - User authentication and authorization logs

### Weekly Evidence
- **Change Management Records** - ServiceNow change tickets
- **Vulnerability Scans** - Nessus/Qualys scan results
- **Capacity Utilization** - Infrastructure capacity reports
- **Incident Tickets** - ServiceNow incident documentation

### Monthly Evidence
- **Access Reviews** - User access certification reports
- **Security Awareness Training** - Training completion metrics
- **Vendor Risk Assessments** - Third-party security evaluations
- **Business Continuity Testing** - DR test results and documentation

### Quarterly Evidence
- **Risk Assessments** - Updated risk register and analysis
- **Penetration Testing** - External security testing results
- **Policy Reviews** - Policy update and approval documentation
- **Control Testing** - Internal audit and testing results

### Annual Evidence
- **Strategic Planning** - Security strategy and objective documentation
- **Board Governance** - Board meeting minutes and oversight records
- **Compliance Certifications** - ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and other certifications
- **Employee Background Checks** - HR verification records

## Evidence Collection Process

### Step 1: Evidence Identification
```
Control Owner → Identifies Required Evidence → Updates Evidence Matrix
```

### Step 2: Collection Automation
```python
# Example: Automated log collection
import boto3
import datetime

def collect_cloudtrail_logs():
    client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')
    end_time = datetime.datetime.now()
    start_time = end_time - datetime.timedelta(days=1)
    
    response = client.lookup_events(
        StartTime=start_time,
        EndTime=end_time,
        MaxItems=1000
    )
    
    return response['Events']
```

### Step 3: Evidence Validation
- **Completeness Check** - Verify all required evidence collected
- **Accuracy Review** - Validate evidence authenticity and correctness
- **Timeliness Verification** - Confirm evidence covers required time periods
- **Format Standardization** - Ensure consistent documentation format

### Step 4: Evidence Storage
```

├── 2024/
│   ├── Q1/
│   │   ├── CC-Common-Criteria/
│   │   ├── A-Availability/
│   │   ├── P-Processing-Integrity/
│   │   ├── C-Confidentiality/

```

## Evidence Management Tools

### Primary Tools
- **SharePoint** - Document repository and version control
- **ServiceNow** - Incident, change, and request management
- **Splunk** - Log aggregation and security monitoring
- **Archer** - GRC platform for risk and compliance management

### Automation Scripts
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily evidence collection script
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
EVIDENCE_DIR="/compliance/evidence/$DATE"

# Create daily evidence directory
mkdir -p "$EVIDENCE_DIR"

# Collect system logs
cp /var/log/auth.log "$EVIDENCE_DIR/auth-log-$DATE.log"
cp /var/log/syslog "$EVIDENCE_DIR/system-log-$DATE.log"

# Export database audit logs
mysqldump --single-transaction audit_db > "$EVIDENCE_DIR/audit-db-$DATE.sql"

# Generate access report
python3 /scripts/generate_access_report.py > "$EVIDENCE_DIR/access-report-$DATE.csv"
```

## Quality Assurance Process

### Evidence Review Checklist
- [ ] Evidence directly supports the control objective
- [ ] Documentation is complete and legible
- [ ] Time periods align with audit requirements
- [ ] Evidence demonstrates control operation throughout the period
- [ ] Any exceptions are properly documented and explained

### Review Responsibilities
- **Control Owner** - Initial evidence review and validation
- **Compliance Team** - Secondary review and quality check
- **Internal Audit** - Independent validation and testing
- **External Auditor** - Final review and acceptance

## Exception Handling

### Exception Documentation Process
1. **Identification** - Control owner identifies control deviation
2. **Documentation** - Complete exception form with details
3. **Root Cause Analysis** - Investigate underlying cause
4. **Remediation Plan** - Develop corrective action plan
5. **Management Review** - Obtain management approval
6. **Monitoring** - Track remediation progress

### Exception Form Template
```
Exception ID: EXC-2024-001
Control ID: CC6.1
Date Identified: 2024-01-15
Description: User access review delayed by 3 days
Root Cause: System maintenance window conflict
Business Impact: Low - no unauthorized access detected
Remediation: Completed review on 2024-01-18
Preventive Action: Updated review schedule to avoid maintenance windows
Status: Closed
Approved By: CISO
```

## Audit Preparation

### Pre-Audit Activities (30 days before)
- [ ] Complete evidence collection for audit period
- [ ] Conduct internal control testing
- [ ] Remediate any identified deficiencies
- [ ] Prepare evidence packages by control
- [ ] Schedule management interviews

### Evidence Package Structure
```
Control CC6.1 - Logical Access Security
├── Control Description and Design
├── Policy Documentation
├── Procedure Documentation
├── Evidence of Operation
│   ├── Monthly Access Reviews (12 months)
│   ├── User Provisioning Records
│   ├── Termination Documentation
│   └── Exception Reports
└── Testing Documentation
```

### Audit Support Process
1. **Auditor Requests** - Centralized through compliance team
2. **Evidence Retrieval** - Automated where possible
3. **Management Interviews** - Scheduled and documented
4. **Testing Observation** - Auditor walkthrough of controls
5. **Finding Response** - Formal response to audit findings

## Continuous Improvement
